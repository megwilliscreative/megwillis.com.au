:content: "Pastor Walo Ani from the Central Papua region in PNG convened meetings
  with key city leaders in Port Moresby on 27-29 July. \n\nLeaders from Church, government,
  business, and independent ministries came together to discuss a city gospel movement
  with an emphasis on the areas of women and youth. Among those in attendance were
  the current chancellor of the Port Moresby university, the former PNG ambassador
  to the US, police, lawyers, key public servants and a young couple currently leading
  an amazing city-wide youth revival with over 8000 young people.\n\nIan Shelton who
  travelled to the meetings with businessman Andrew Youngberry said “We found them
  hungry for the things of God and desperate for the state of their city and the nation.
  Leaders in attendance admitted that the church in PNG in its current form was not
  cutting through even though there were many individual good news stories.”\n\nLeaders
  in attendance at the meetings agreed to form a working group to work towards a Movement
  Day PNG to run in the next year or two. Many were keen to see a kingdom minded gathering
  under the umbrella of Movement Day supported and embraced.\n\n“We are very thankful
  to the Lord for the time we had to together and how much the Lord had gone ahead
  of all those involved by preparing hearts and bringing such a wonderful group of
  leaders together”."
