:content: "Are we playing catch-up on a story that God has already been telling?\n\nMany
  of us have asked what a transformed city can look like yet there are stories popping
  up all around us. However, to bridge the gap between these pockets of transformation
  to an entire city can be challenging. Below, Gerard Kelly shared a short vision
  inspiring piece at Movement Day UK in 2017 on what he sees a transformed city can
  look like. \n\n\n> __I See A New City__\n> \n> I see a new city, poured out from
  Heaven\n> Dressed for a party; blazing with beauty\n> Her rooftops are radiant,
  trees trembling with laughter\n> And joy like a jewel shines in her streets.\n>
  \n> From her walls and windows\n> No weeping is heard\n> Through her gateways and
  gutters\n> Floods of tears do not flow\n> For in her homes and houses no pain dwells\n>
  Bricks once broken down in mourning\n> Rise again in song and celebration\n> Stones
  thrown down by enmity and envy\n> Dare to dance in swirling swathes of mercy\n>
  \n> She sings: a million voices rising\n> The long-lost languages of human hopes\n>
  The secret praise of human hearts, released at last\n> Because her God is with her\n>
  Because his home is made\n> Within her walls\n> Because his voice is heard\n> Gentle
  like the rains of spring\n> Declaring: New! New! New!\n> \n> This is the city I
  see\n> The future I belong to\n> This is the blueprint my heart holds on to\n> Even
  now, in streets that sing another story\n> Even here, beneath a darker vision’s
  shadow\n> This metropolis of mercy\n> Promising future realisation\n> Active now
  in Love’s imagination\n> This is my dream\n> And though I wait, and though I long\n>
  And though the sacred city may seem slow:\n> Still I will hope\n> Still I will pray\n>
  Still I will today\n> Rise up and build.\n> \n> By Gerard Kelly\n"
