:content: "In virtually all the ancient cultures of the world, the power of the gods
  was channelled through and identified with the elites of society, the kings, priests,
  and military captains, not the outcasts. To oppose the leaders of society, then,
  was to oppose the gods. However, Biblical writers introduce God as “a father to
  the fatherless, a defender of widows” (Ps 68:4-5). This vision is not high-ranking
  males but “the orphan, the widow, and the stranger” with whom Yahweh takes his stand.
  His power is exercised in history for their empowerment. So, from ancient times,
  the God of the Bible stood out from the gods of all other religions as a God on
  the side of the powerless, and of justice for the poor.\n\n> *This is what the LORD
  Almighty says: Administer true justice, show mercy and compassion to one another.
  Do not oppress the widow or the fatherless, the immigrant or the poor - Zechariah
  7:10-11.*\n\nTo walk with God, we must do justice, out of merciful love. Justice
  reflects the Character of God, and to reflect the Character of God we must also
  reflect His justice. We are called do justice in our neighbourhoods, our cities
  and our nation by ministering in both word and deed, through the local church and
  as individual agents dispersed throughout the world. \n\nTo “do justice” means to
  live in a way that generates a strong community where human beings can flourish.
  Specifically, however, to “do justice” means to go to places where the fabric of
  shalom has broken down, where the weaker members of societies are falling through
  the fabric, and to repair it. This happens when we concentrate on and meet the needs
  of the poor.\n\nHow can we do that? The only way to reweave and strengthen the fabric
  is by weaving yourself into it. Human beings are like those threads thrown together
  onto a table. If we keep our money, time, and power to ourselves, for ourselves,
  instead of sending them out into our neighbours’ lives, then we may be literally
  on top of one another, but we are not interwoven socially, relationally, financially,
  and emotionally. Reweaving shalom means to sacrificially thread, lace, and press
  your time, goods, power, and resources into the lives and needs of others.\n\n>
  *“For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I
  was a stranger and you welcomed me, I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and
  you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me… “Truly, I say to you, as you
  did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me” Matthew 25:35-40*\n\nThe
  God of the Bible says, as it were, “I am the poor on your step. Your attitude toward
  them reveals what your true attitude is toward me.” A life poured out in doing justice
  for the poor is the inevitable sign on any real, true gospel faith.\n\nTimothy Keller\nRedeemer,
  New York\n"
