:content: "Ian Shelton, Letitia Shelton and Andrew Youngberry attended MD Africa in
  Nairobi, Kenya on 23-24 August 2018.\n\nAn estimated 500 leaders from 49 cities
  across the African continent were present for the two days. There was a great variety
  of speakers from the various spheres of society including some great women and youth
  leaders. Ian said \"I was impressed with the high calibre of leaders especially
  the business leaders. One western leader said he had never been at a MD conference
  with such breadth of speakers covering so many facets of city life\".\n\nThe African
  continent has many challenges but there was a sense that the Holy Spirit was saying
  that now is the time for the cities of Africa to be impacted by the gospel as the
  church rises to its task. “It was an inspiring and challenging MD”.\n\nAt the conclusion
  those who wanted to sign the MD Nairobi Agreement were commissioned to return to
  their cities to begin the conversation towards city impact. “This was a particularly
  inspiring and emotional time as the African leaders celebrated in true African style”.
  Many leaders will return to their cities with plans for their own MD. \n\n“Leaders
  are coming together in new ways with a new urgency to proclaim the gospel of the
  Kingdom. One of the unique features is how market place leaders, young and old are
  connecting with Church leaders for greater effectiveness. Prominent women leaders
  from all the spheres are another feature. Racial reconciliation was demonstrated
  as a white South African leader publicly repented to a black woman leader. God is
  at work.”\n"
